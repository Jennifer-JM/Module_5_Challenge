---

## Overview

This project analyzes data from a mouse study to evaluate the effects of various drug regimens on tumor growth and mouse characteristics

---

## Key Highlights

* Cleaned and prepared datasets by merging records and removing duplicates
* Generated summary statistics for tumor volume across drug regimens
* Created comprehensive visualizations to explore the data:
  * Bar charts for drug regimen timepoints
  * Pie charts for gender distribution
  * Box plots for tumor volume across selected drug regimens
  * Line plot for tumor volume progression in a single subject
  * Scatter plot showing the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume under the Capomulin regimen
* Calculated correlation and performed linear regression analysis for Capomulin-related observations

## Deliverables

* Visualizations and statistical insights derived from the analysis
* Code and findings documented in Python using Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy libraries
